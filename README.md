# Python-Pygame-Space-Invaders

Python-Pygame Space Invaders

* This is a classic Space Invaders game implementation from me.
* I used PyGame for this poroject.

* The game is played by right, left arrow keys and space button.
* You can move around the screen by arrow keys and shoot by space.
* Enemies will appear on the top of the screen and shoot randomly.
* If an enemy hits you, your health score goes down.
* When all enemies are killed, you win! Game is over.

* On the V1.2 you can replay by pressing enter (Still working on it doesn't function yet)
